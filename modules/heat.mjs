/* 

GOAL : Given a certain level of heat resource & production, electrical resource & prodction, 
and which generation you are in, can you reach max level tempearture? 

Future TODOS:
- Which generation will you reach max temperature? (When can you shift your focus?)
- Depending on your income, can you supplement using Standard Projects (i.e. buying an Asteroid to raise temperature?)

# Given a certain heat_resource, production, generation, will you reach max temperature by final generation?
